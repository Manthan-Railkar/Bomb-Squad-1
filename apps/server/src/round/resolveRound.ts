/**
 * Round-resolution ceremony (Story 8.5). The single code path all three outcomes
 * — defuse, 3rd strike, timeout — funnel through. The server RECORDS and
 * ANNOUNCES the result; it does not block on the cinematic (the 2s/3s scene holds
 * are client-side presentation, Task 5).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY FENCE (AC-4, per-team): a single `RoundState` is shared by both
 * racing teams, so its round-level `status` cannot express per-team resolution.
 * The authoritative per-team once-only fence is therefore the team's LIVE TIMER
 * KEY: it exists exactly once per active team and is deleted the first time that
 * team resolves. A second trigger for an already-resolved team (a late strike
 * after a defuse, a timer wake firing after an early defuse) finds no timer key
 * and is a logged no-op — never a second BOMB_DEFUSED/BOMB_EXPLODED, never a
 * double time entry. This is the same desync posture `onTimerExpired`'s fire path
 * and `escalateOnStrike` already use (timer-key-null → no-op). RoundState.status
 * is still recorded as the round-level outcome (last-writer-wins across teams);
 * the per-team result is carried by which event fired + that team's
 * cumulativeTimeMs (matching the ScoreboardPayload contract).
 *
 * ELAPSED-TIME CONVENTION: TWO values, computed once here from the live
 * `TimerState` via `timerCore.remainingMs` (the only timer math):
 *  - `displayedElapsedMs` = `config.timerMs - remainingMs(timer, now)` — the actual
 *    moment the round ended, bounded to [0, timerMs]; carried by the BOMB_DEFUSED/
 *    BOMB_EXPLODED announcement (Story 8.5 AC-5; preserves the 8.4 timeout = timerMs
 *    decision and the strike-accelerated countdown baked into `remainingMs`).
 *  - `scoredElapsedMs` (Story 8.10 AC-1) = the value RECORDED into
 *    cumulativeTimeMs/roundTimesMs. A `defused` round scores its displayed elapsed;
 *    a FAILED round (`exploded`/`time-expired`) scores a FULL-TIMER PENALTY
 *    (`timerMs`) so failing is never cheaper than defusing (Jay's decision,
 *    resolving the bugs-epic8:15 fast-fail loophole). Story 8.10 sums this.
